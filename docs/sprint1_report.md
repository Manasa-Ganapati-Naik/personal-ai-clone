## Abstract
This report summarizes Sprint 1 of the Personal AI Clone project, focusing on designing a personalized text generation system that adapts to an individual's style. The project covers literature research, requirements gathering, data planning, consent and privacy compliance, backend architecture, ethics considerations, and initial evaluation metrics.

## Introduction
- Problem: Existing virtual assistants are generic.
- Goal: Build a system that generates text in a user's unique style.
- Sprint 1 focus: Research, requirements, data plan, architecture, ethics, evaluation planning.

## Literature Review
- Key sources summarized from `research/lit_review.md`.
- Transformer fundamentals, adapter tuning, prompt tuning, personalization techniques.

## Requirements
- Functional & non-functional requirements (`docs/requirements.md`).
- Success criteria: embedding similarity >0.75, human preference >60%.

## Data Plan & Consent
- Types of data collected.
- Anonymization and storage details.
- Consent form template (`data_plan/consent_form.txt`).

## Architecture
- Include `docs/architecture.png`.
- Explain data flow and components.

## Ethics & Evaluation
- GDPR alignment, informed consent.
- Evaluation metrics: embeddings, perplexity, human ratings, safety checks.

## Deliverables
- Research outputs (`lit_review.md`, `bibliography.md`)
- Architecture diagram (`architecture.png`)
- Requirements, ethics/privacy docs
- Evaluation plan & templates

## Next Steps for Sprint 2
- Implement backend model fine-tuning.
- Connect React frontend.
- Build `/generate` API.
- Collect initial user data for personalization.
