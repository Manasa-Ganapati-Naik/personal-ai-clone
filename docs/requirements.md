# Requirements — Personal AI Clone

## Problem Statement
Existing virtual assistants and writing aids are generic and cannot reflect an individual user's unique style, tone, or preferences. The Personal AI Clone aims to emulate a user's communication style to generate personalized text drafts and reply suggestions. This will enhance productivity and consistency in personal or professional messaging while maintaining privacy and ethical standards.

## Scope (MVP)
For Sprint 2, the initial prototype will focus on a minimal viable product (MVP) with the following boundaries:

- Text-only interface (no voice input/output).  
- Draft message generation and reply suggestion only (no automatic sending of messages).  
- Single-user mode (no multi-user sharing or collaborative features).  
- Support for local model deployment or hosted transformer models that allow fine-tuning with user-provided data.

**Note:** This scope limits complexity while demonstrating core personalization functionality.

## Functional Requirements
1. **Data Upload**: Users can upload their personal text data in CSV or TXT format.  
2. **Data Preprocessing & Anonymization**: System cleans, tokenizes, and optionally anonymizes user data to remove sensitive identifiers.  
3. **Model Adaptation**: Fine-tune or adapter-tune a transformer model to capture user-specific linguistic patterns.  
4. **Text Generation Interface**: Provide a simple UI where users input a prompt and the system generates text in the user’s style.  
5. **Review & Edit Workflow**: Users can review generated text and make edits before using or sending it, ensuring safety and control over outputs.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Data Security**: All user data must be encrypted at rest using AES-256.  
- **Privacy & Consent**: Explicit consent must be captured before using any personal data for model adaptation.  
- **Performance**: Inference latency target of < 2 seconds for demo purposes.  
- **Usability**: Intuitive interface requiring minimal setup.  
- **Maintainability**: Code and model configurations should be documented for easy updates or future extensions.

## Success Criteria
1. **Embedding Similarity**: Cosine similarity between generated text embeddings and user's text embeddings > 0.75.  
2. **Human Evaluation**: In A/B testing, at least 60% of users prefer the model-generated text over a baseline generic model.  
3. **Regulatory Compliance**: Data handling and storage follow GDPR basics, including explicit consent and user data control.  
4. **System Reliability**: MVP can handle user text uploads and generate outputs without crashing, for a sample dataset of up to 5,000 text entries.

**Optional Notes for Future Iterations**  
- Multi-user mode for collaborative or team environments.  
- Integration with messaging platforms or email clients.  
- Voice input/output for accessibility.  
- Continuous online learning for adapting to evolving user style over time.
